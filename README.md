This is the first iteration of playing with my tachometer for my truck. 

The truck is an '87 F350 with a 460 and a 4 speed, so the values are set up for that. 

I needed a way to send pretty large swings of values so I used a 10k pot to do that.

This uses an Arduino Nano and a 24 Neopixel ring from Adafruit.  The 220 ohm resistor is just to smooth things out. 
The OLED is from diymall.com and is a 128x64 using their SSD1306 driver and not the one from Adafruit.k
